# day_planner

As a busy employee, I wanted to create a day planner that would show the current date and have a place for me to enter appointments and tasks throughout the day. I also wanted the planner indicate if a scheduled item was in the past, present, or future. If it was a new day, I wanted the ability to clear the schedule from the previous day.

Using Moment.js, I was able to achieve all of the criteria listed above. I was also able to manipulate the DOM to create the time blocks.
